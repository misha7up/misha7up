Graduated from OSTU with a <b>bachelor's degree of Applied Computer Science</b>.

During my studies, I've programmed <b>a project on parsing social networks for MGD</b>, took part in programming competitions, solved problems on Codewars, LeetCode and Codeforces platforms.

Made some <b>PET-projects for self-usage</b>, i.e. parsers and automators via Python, Delphi and various clickers (e.g. Clickermann with its own language); <b>developed chatbots</b> that are interacting with APIs of websites, social networks and messengers; <b>developed game bots</b> based on image analysis using OpenCV.

ATM <b>refreshing my knowledge on Backend-development</b>, taking a course at Yandex.Praktikum. I have actual experience with Python, Django, SQL, Git, different APIs and Python parsing libraries, such as Scrapy/Selenium/Beautiful Soup.

Fast learner, good at googling, easy to fit into workflows. Not afraid of complex tasks and routine, willing to dig in/deal with it.
